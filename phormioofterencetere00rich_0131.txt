THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

NA. Patiently-—why should I? Ι certainly do want to
have an end of it all, I'm so w1·etehed; but how could I
expect that? can I count on 1115 5111111113 1655 as he grows
older? He was an old man even then, if it ’5 old age that
makes men virtuous. Do my own looks or my years make
me more attractive now than I was then, Demipho? Come,
what can you offer to make me expect or 111151 11131 11115
