THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 63

CH. Pray be quiet. I ’ll pay it myself. All you ’ve got
to do is to make your son marry the girl we wish.

AN. (asz‘dc.) Oh, dear me! you 've been the death of
me, Geta, with your tricks. CH. She is turned out for my
sake, and so it 's fair for me to be the loser. GE. ‘ Let me

her to me, so that Ι may get rid of this other girl, and not

Lemnos. I'll take it out of that, and tell my wife that you
needed it. (Exemzt DE. and CH. to CHREMES‘S.)

answer another? GE. Why, what are you talking about?

to succeed in a thing, leave it to this fellow, who can bring
you out of smooth sailing straight on to a rockl Why,
what could have been worse than to lay your finger on this
sore and to mention my wife? Here ’s my father made to
hope that he can cast her off. Come now, what follows?
Suppose Phormio gets the dowry and has to marry her,
