THE PHORAHO OF TERENCE

SCENE VI

PH. What shall Ι do? where am Ι to find the money for
him in such a hurry, when I've less than nothing myself,
poor fellow? It was promised to me, if·I could only have
begged these three days out of him!

AN. Shall we let him be made so unhappy, Geta, after
he has just helped me, as you tell me, in such a friendly
way? why not try to return his kindness now when it ’5
needed? ,

GE. I know of course it ’5 only the fair thing to do.

AN. Come, then, you are the only man who can save him.

GE. What can I do?

AN. Find the money.

GE. Ι want to; but where ? tell me that.

AN. My father 's here.

GE. I know he is, but what of it?

AN. Oh, a word t'o the wise is quite enough.

GE. That ’s it, hey? AN. That's it.

GE. And a fine suggestion, too, by cracky! Get out,
won’t you? is n't it triumph enough if I get off from your
marriage with a whole skin without your telling me, when
I 'm in the stocks already, to try to get hanged for his sake?

AN. There 's truth in what he says.

PH. What, Geta, arn I a mere stranger to all of you?

GE. Ι suppose not; but is 'nt it enough that the old man
is so very angry with us all now, without our prodding him
still more, so as to leave us no chance to cry off ?

PH. And shall another man carry her off to foreign parts
before my very eyes? Ah me! well, then, you two, talk
to me and look your fill on me while you may, Antipho, and
while I ’m here.
