THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

Where are the ladies? ΞΟ. Oh, dear me! CH. Hey ?
what ’s the matter? are n’t they alive?

SO. Your daughter is; but her mother, poor thing, died
os grief.

CH. Too bad!

SO. And so I, being only a lone lorn old woman, whom
nobody knew, did my best and got the girl married to the
young gentleman who lives in here.

CH. To Antipho? -

So. Certainly ; the very man.

CH. What! has he got two wives?

SO. For pity’s sake, no; she ’s the only one he has.

CH. What about the other who is called his relative?

ΞΟ. Why, it’ 5 5116, of course.

CH. W hat' s that you say?

SO It was a put- up job, —the only way by which her'

lover might get her without a dow ry.

CH. Heaven help us! how often things do turn out by
hap-hazard which you ’d scarcely dare to wish for! Here
I've come home'and ‘found my daughter married to the
very man I wanted and just as I wanted it! The very thing
that we were bothtrying with all our might to bring about,
he has taken the greatest trouble to do all by himself with-
out any trouble of ours,

ΞΟ. Well now, just see what ’5 to be done next. The
young man’s father has arrived, and they say that he is
bitterly opposed to it.

CH. There 's no danger at all. But, by heaven and
earth, don’t let anybody find out that she is my daughter.

SO. Nobody shall from me.

CH. Follow me; you shall hear the rest inside.
