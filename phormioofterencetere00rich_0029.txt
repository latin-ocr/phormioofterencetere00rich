SCENE 1

(E nter DAVOS, R.)

DA. My particular friend and countryman, Geta, came to
see me yesterday. I had been owing him some small bal·
ance of cash on account a good while, and he asked me to
get it together. I've got it together, and I’m bringing it
to him now. The fact is, I'm told that his master's son has
got married; it ’s for the girl, I suppose, that he 's scraping
this testimonial together. How unfair it is that poor folks
should always be adding something to rich people’s piles!
Now here ’s Geta; —the poor fellow 's been saving up out
of his rations a pint at a time, and hardly that, cheating
his own belly, and now my lady 'll spoil him os it all without
ever thinking what a lot of work it took to get it. Then
besides they ’ll strike him for another testimonial when she
has a baby; and then another too when the baby has a
birthday, and another when it gets initiated. The mother,
os course, will wall< off with it all, and the child will be only
an excuse for the gift. But don’t Ι see Geta?
