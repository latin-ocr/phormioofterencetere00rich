THE I‘IIORMIO OF TERENCL‘. 97

NA. But what?

CH. There ’s 110 need of telling.

PH. Not sor you of course, but she ought to know. In
Lemnos —

NA. Ah! what 's that you say?

CH. XVon't you hold your tongue?

Pn. Behind your back —

CH. Oh dear me!

PH. He married another wife. ’

NA. God forbid, my dear man!

PH. It's true. .

NA. Alas! I ’111 undone!

PH. And by her he ’s already had one daughter too,
without your dreaming of it. -»

CH. What shall I do?

NA. Oh heavens'! what a wicked, shameful thing!

PH. Do? you ’re done for!

NA. &Vas there ever anything more infamous! XVhen it
comes to their wives, they ’re old enough, forsooth! Demi-
pho, 1 appeal to you, sor I am sici< of talking to this creature.
This was the meaning, was it, of all those constant trips and
long stays at Lemnos? this was the low prices that reduced
our rents there?

DE. For rny part, Nausistrata, Ι (1011’1 say that he does n’t
deserve to be blamed in this matter, but it is a fault that
may be pardoned.

PH. Might as well talk to the dead.

DE. The fact is, it was not that he did n't care sor you or
that he disliked you. His affair with this woman was
about fifteen years ago, once when he had drunk too much,
and that was how 11115 girl came to be born; he never went
near the woman afterwai‘ds; she 15 dead and out of the way:
that was the only stumbling-block left. And 50 Ι beg of

you that you will bear this patiently, as you act in other
things.
