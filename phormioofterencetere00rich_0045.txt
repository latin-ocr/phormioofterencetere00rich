THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

AN. I'm all abroad! GE. But that 's just where you
must n't be now, Antipho; for your father will think you
guilty if he sees you srightened.

PH. That ’s true. AN. Ifflcan’t change my nature.

GE. Suppose you had to do something still harder, what
then? AN. As Ι can’t do this, I could do that still less.

GE. It’s no use, Phaedria; it ’s all over. Why waste our
time here for nothing? I’m off. PH. And Ι too (going).

sf‘r‘ssN. For rnercy’s sake! Suppose I make believe? will
this do ? (strz‘kes an altitude.) GE. Silly!

* ⁴ AN. But just look at my face. There! is that satisfac-
}ory? GE. No. AN. How about this? ⁴

GE. Pretty fair. AN. And this?

GE. That will do. Keep that, and look out that you
answer'him word for word, tit for tat, so that he shan't
rout‘you with harsh language while'he 's in a passion.

AN. Ι understand. GE. Say you were forced into it,
against your will. PH. By the law—by the court.

‘A GE. Do you catch on? But who ’s that old man Ι 566
down the street? it's the governor!

AN. Ι can’t face him. GE. Here! what are you doing?
where are you going, Antipho? wait, Ι say.

AN. I know rnyself and my own fault. Ι leave Pha-
nium and my own life in your hands. (lenus off, R.)
lffflff· What 's going to be done now, Geta?

GE. You'll get a wigging pretty soon, and Ι shall
be strung up and whipped, if I'm not mistaken. But
we ought to do ourselves. Phaedria, just what we were
advising Antipho.

PH. None of your ‘oughtss Just give me your orders
what I'm to do.

GE. Do you remember what you said long ago when we
started in with this affair, about protecting ourselves from
trouble,—that the other side’s case was just, easy, sure to

win, the best in the world ?
