DE. Geta! PH. (aside.) Answer him.

GE. XVhom have we here? oh! DE. Hold your tongue!

GE. Why, he 's beeri? insulting you all day long behind
your back, —- insults that don’t fit you and do fit him.

DE. Avast there! hold on! Young man (to Pu), to
begin with, I want to ask you this, with your kind permis-
sion, if you will be good enough to answer me: Explain to
me who this friend of yours was you ’re talking about, and
how he said that Ι was related to him.

PH. There you are,> fishing; as if you did n't know.

DE. Did n't know? PH. Yes. DE. I say Ι don’t; but
you, who say I do, just jog my memory.

PH. &Vhan man ! not know your own cousin?

DE. You ’re killing me. Tell me his name.

PH. His name; of course. DE. Why don’t you speak?

PH. (assde.) By the powers, I'm a gonerl I've for-
gotten the name. DE What 'S that you say?

PH. (asida 2¹0 GE.) Geta, just prompt me if you recol·
lect the name that was given at the time. (Aloud.) No, Ι
won't tell you. You ’re here to pump me, as if you did n't
know it yourself. DE. What! Pumping you?

I care? It ’s Stilpo. DE. &Vhom did you say?

PH. Stilpo, Ι tell you; you knew him. DE. I did n't
know him either, and Ι never had a relative of such a name.

PH. So, so? Don't you feel abashed before these gen-
tlemen Ρ Yet if he had left a property worth ten talents —

DE. Oh confound you!

trace your ancestry all the way from grandfather and great-
grandfather.
