THE PHORAEHO oF TERENCE

SCENE H

(Euter G’r'nA, R.)

GE. (assde.) A shrewder fellow than Phormio I never
saw in my born days. I went to tell him that money was
wanted and how it was to be got. Ι had hardly told him
half the story when he understood it alh—began to laugh‚
congratulated me, asked where the old man was. Then he
thanked heaven that now he had a chance to show that he
was as much of a friend to Phaedria as to Antipho. Ι told
the fellow to wait on 'Chan‘ga and said that I would bring
the old man there. H‘olloa! here he is. Who's that on
the other sicle? Oh my! Phaedria’s father 's come home.
Lubber that I am, what was I afraid of? was it because Ι ’ν6
got two to trick instead of one? It's handier, I think, to
have two strings to your bow, I’ll try to get the money
from the man Ι meant originally. If he gives it, all right;

if nothing can be done with him, then I’ll attack this
newcomer.

SCENE HI

(Enter ANTIPHO‚ unobserved, R.)

AN. (aside.) I 'm expecting Geta back every minute.
Why, there ’s my uncle standing with my father. Dear me!

how I do sear what father may be driven to by his coming! *⁴

GE. I’ll go up. Why! our good friend Chremes! how
do you do ? CH. How do you do, Geta?

GE. I’m delighted to see you back sase. CH. Dare say.

GE. How goes it? Do you find many surprises here, as
usual when a man comes home? CII. A good many.

GE. To be sure. Have you heard what 's happened to
Antipho? CH. The whole story.
