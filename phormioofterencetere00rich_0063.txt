THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

DE. Very likely, as you say. Well, when Ι came sor-
ward I should have stated how she was related to me. Now,
you do the same. Come, how is she related? GE. Bravo,
master, well done 1 and you, sir, look out for yourself.

PH. My duty was to explain it to the court, and I (lid

that ’5 closed,’ as the saying goes, DE. Don't open it? on
the contrary, I 'll never rest until I 've seen it through.

PH. Silly of you. DE. You just let me alone.

PH. In short, Demipho, I've nothing to do with you. It

marrying was gone long ago.

DE. You can take him as saying all that 1 say now;
