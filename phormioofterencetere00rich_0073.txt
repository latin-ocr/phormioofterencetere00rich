AN. (coming seward.) Why, Phaedria, what is all
this ?

PH. Oh, Antipho, you luckiest of men l

AN. I?

PH. Yes; for the girl you love is in your own keeping,
and you ’ve never had occasion to struggle with such a
difficulty as mine.

AN. In my own keeping? not quite so; I'm ‘holding a

Pamphila.

ΑΝ. What! sold her?

GE. You don’t say so! sold her?

PH. Yes, he ’s sold her.

If Ι don’t pay it by that time, you need n‘t wait for me an
hour longer.

AN. will you let Pamphila be carried away froin this
town, and can you bear to see such a pair of lovers
torn asunder?

Do. Of course I can’t any more than you.
