THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

GE. How does it come about?

ΡΗ. It 's because we never set traps for the hawks and
kites that really hurt us ; it 's only sor birds that don’t hurt
that traps are set. There 's something to be made out os s
them, but 011Γ others it ’s only time thrown away. Other
people have their dangerssfromssne source or another,—
people something can be got out of; but everybody knows
that I've got nothing to lose. “But perhaps you 'll say
that they ’ll convict me and take me home to hold me
there. Oh, no3 they don’t want to keep 3 ravenous fellow
like me; they don't want to do good for evil, and that 's
where they ’re wise, I think.

GE. Well, he can’t ever thank ⁷you as much as you
deserve. .

PH. Not quite 50. Nobody ever ean thank his patron as
much as he deserves. Think of it! You come scot free to his
dinner, all persumedand shining from the bath, with a heart
free from care,-when he ‘s drowned with worry and eaten up
with expenses. While everything's done to your liking,
he ’s snarling* You 6311 laugh, drink your wine before
him, take the higher seat; and then a puzzling banquet ’5
spread. '

GE. What’s that?

ΡΗ. That ‘s when you 're puzzled what to help yourself
to first. Now, when you eorne to reckon up how nice all
this is and how rnuch it‘costs, are n't you obliged to think
your host a god incarnate right before your eyes?

GE. Here ’s·the old manssmind what you ’re about; the
first onset is always the fiercest. If you stand that, you
may afterwards make p‘lay 35 you like.
