THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

PH. Away with your promises and out with your
news !

GE. What! you here too, Phormio?

PII. Yes,' but why don’t you go ahead?

GE. well, then, listen. After we had paid you the money
on yChange, we started straight home3 then master sent me
over to see your wife.

AN. What for?

GE. Ι ’11 leave that out; it ’s nothing to do with the case,
Antipho. Just as I was entering my lady's chamber, Mida,
her slave boy, ran up to me, caught me by the cloak behind
and pulled me back. Ι looked round and asked him what
he was stopping me for. He said that there was no admis—
sion to his mistress. ¹ Sophrona has just brought in the old
man's brother Chremes and he 's in there now with the
ladies,’ says he. When Ι heard that, I went up sostly on
tiptoe, stood still, held my breath and put my ear against
the door; and I began to listen‚ trying to catch their talk
so fashion.

PH. Bravo, Geta!

GE. XVhereupon'I heard a most beautiful piece os busi—
ness; so much so that, by craeky, Ι nearly shouted sor joy.

AN. what was ita,

GE. well, what do you think?

ΑΝ. Ι don’t know. η

GE. But it ’s most marvellous! Your uncle has proved
to be your wife Phanium’s father.

AN. What 's that you say?

GE. He lived with her mother at Lemnos unbeknownst.

PII. You ’re dreaming! as if the girl would n’t know her
own father!

GE. Oh well, depend upon it, Phormio, there ’s some
reason sor that3 but do you think that Ι, outside of the
door, could understand everything that went on between
them inside?
