THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 89

CH. Ι5 11’1 5116 3 thorough lady though, as Ι told you?

DE. Through and through. &Vc must now find Phormio
as soon as possible and get our thirty ducats away from
him before he makes ducks and drakes of them.

Pil. (coming sm‘wczrd.) I'll just see whether Demipho
is at home, so 35 10 —— DE. Ah, we were just going to see
you, Phormio. PH. On the same old errand, perhaps?

DE. Yes, to be sure. PH. I supposed 50. But what
made you think it necessary to come? DE. Oh pooh!

PH. Did you think Ι would n't do what I had once under-
taken? See here, however poor Ι may be, there 's one thing
I've always been particular about, and that is to keep my
word. And so Ι 631116 to tell you this, Demipho, that I'm
all ready. Give me my wife whenever you wish. Ι 113ν6
put off all my other business, and properly enough too,
when I saw how very bent you were upon it.

DE. But Chremes here has persuaded me not to give
her to you. ‘ Why, what will Mrs. Gru'ndy say,' says he, ‘ if
you do that? A while ago, when you could have done it
decently, you did n’t release her. To turn her out now,
divorced, is an outrage’ In fact, his arguments were all
pretty much the same that you urged against me yourself 3
while ago face to face.

PH. You ’16 making game of me in a pretty high and
mighty way. DE. How ’s that?

PH. How ’5 that? Why, because Ι shan't be able to
marry that other girl now. For how could Ι have the sace
to go back to the woman aster slighting her?

CH. (asida to DE.) ‘Besides Ι 566 11131 Antipho does 11’1

want to let her leave him ’ — say that.
DE. Resides I see that my son does n’t at all want to let

the woman leave him. So come over to the bank, please,
and have that money transferred to me again, Phormio.

PII. What! after Ι have already paid it round among my
different creditors?
