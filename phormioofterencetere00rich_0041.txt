THE PHORhHO OF TERENCE.

To say nothing of your having got a well-born lady without
any expense, and of having the wife of your choico publicly
acknowledged, and without any scandal! Here you are per-
fectly happy except sor one thing, ——— a temper to bear it all
with equanimity. If you had to deal with a slave-trader
like that one of mine, then you ’d find out! But that’s the
way almost all of us are made ; we 're dissatisfied with our
own lot.

AN. On the contrary, Phaedria, it seems to me that you
are the lucky man. You 're still perfectly free to make up
your mind to your liking—to keep your sweetbeart or
to give her up. But 1, unluckily‚ have got into such a fix
that Ι can* neither keep mine nor let her go either. But
what ’s here? Is n’t this Geta I see running up this way?
it 's the very man. Oh, dear me, l’m dreadfully frightened
about the news he rnay be bringing! (leey retz're up.)

SCENE H

(Enter GETA‚ lzastily from tlze port.)

GE. You 're done for, Geta, unless you find some way
out and mighty quick! Such troubles threaten you all of
asudden and you 're so unprepared. I don't see how to
dodge thern or how to get myself out of this fix. Our
reckless doings can't possibly be concealed any longer.

AN. (aside.) Why in the world is the man come in such
a fright?

GE. Besides, I’ ve only a minute to think of it; master 's
close by.

AN. (asz'de.) What ’s this trouble?

GE. Once he’s heard of it, how shall I head off his fury?
