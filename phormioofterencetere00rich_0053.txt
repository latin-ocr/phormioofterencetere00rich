THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 27

GE. It was n't on account, —it was cash down that was
wanted. DE. He should have got it somewhere or other.

GE. Somewhere or other? Nothin‘g easicr to squ !

DE. On interest, at the worst, if on no other tei-ms.

GE. Bless my soul 1 pretty fine talk! as if anybody would
have trusted him, with you alive!

DE. No, no; it shan’t be so; it can’t be. What! let
her stay on as his wife a single day? This is no case for
kindness. But I want to have that man pointed out to mc,
or to be shown where he lives. GE. You mean Phormio?

DE. The woman's next friend.

GE. I ’ll bring him here at once.

DE. XVhere ’s Antipho now? GE. Out.

DE. Go and look for him, Phaedria, and bring him here.

PH. I ’11 make a bee line. (Exit to DORIO’S.)

GE. (asz'de.) Yes, to Pamphila's. (Exit R.)

DE. As for me, I'll turn in home and pay my respects
to my household gods, and then go on 'Change and call some
friends to stand by me in this affair, so that I shan't be un-
prepared in case of Pho'rmio’s coming. (Exit to lzz‘s house.)
