THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

DE. If it was n't so, you would n’t be taking his part,
Phaedria.

PH. well, uncle, if it is a fact that Antipho has done a
wrong, regardless of his interests or reputation, I have
nothingffo say against his suffering' as he has deservcd.
But if somebody took advantage of his own cunning to
lay a snare for our youthful innocence and has caught us
in it, is it our fault or that os the judges? You know what
a habit they have of robbihg the rich from envy, and giving
to the poor from pity. ·

GE. (asz‘de.) If Ι did n't know the case, I should believe
that he was telling the truth. DE. Is there a judge alive
who can possibly know your rights when you don’t answer
a word yours'elf‚ like that son of mfne ?

PH. He behaved like a young} man of good breeding.
When we got into court, he could n’t speak his piece; his
ffibdesty struck him quite dumb then and there.

GE. (aside.) Bravo, you! but shall I not address the
old man at once? (going sorward.) Good day, master.
I'm glad yo⁵u 've got home safe.

DE. Ha, ha! fine guardian, good day, main stay of my
house; it was in your charge that I left my son when I
went away. .

GE> I've heard you blaming us all sor ever so long when
we did n't deserve it, and I least of anybody. Why, what
would you have had me do in the matter? the laws don't
allow a man who ’s a slave to pleadffand he can't give
evidence eitlie3r.

DE. I waive all that, and Ι admit this, too, that the boy
was afraid and unsuspecting. I grant that you arc a slave.
But no matter how near a relative she was, he need n't have
married her; n0, no, ,You should have given her a dowry,
as the law direct'S, and let her look out for another hus-
band. On what account, then, did he prefer to bring home
a pauper?
