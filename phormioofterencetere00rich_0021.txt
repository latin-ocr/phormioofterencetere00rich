THE PROLOGUE
ΒΥ J. Β. GREENOUGH

That this to all be prospered is our prayer;
Patrons of noble arts and judges fair,

We are to act a play, a Latin c ne,

By Tully witnessed and by Re :ius done,

The work of Terence; with such names as these
To recommend us, we must surely please.

I called it Latin, I was partly wrong3

No doubt the verses to that tongue bele·1g;
But incidents and thought are purely Greek,
The Latin part is but the words we speak.

For just as that we call an English play

Is what some Frenchman elever in that way
Has made before; so Romans thought no shame
To take from Greece and publish in their name.
What use, then, now to offer you a play

Not even native and long past its day,

A scenie outline when in Greek 't was made,
And now a faded shadow of that shade ?
Because while ages keep their steady paee,

The airns and nature of the human race
Continue still the same; their sear and woe,
Their joys and their desires, no changes show.
The Latin that we speak in Grecian dress
Mirrors the nature of our age no less.

Only the outward acts and garb are old,

The rest is fresh as when 't was first unrolled. —
